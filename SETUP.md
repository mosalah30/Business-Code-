# Setup Guide - Business Card Scanner App

This guide will help you set up and run the Business Card Scanner app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Software

1. **Flutter SDK** (version 3.9.2 or higher)

   - Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Verify installation: `flutter --version`

2. **Dart SDK** (version 3.9.0 or higher)

   - Comes bundled with Flutter
   - Verify: `dart --version`

3. **Git**

   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Verify: `git --version`

4. **IDE** (Choose one)
   - Android Studio (recommended): https://developer.android.com/studio
   - VS Code with Flutter extension: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### For Android Development

5. **Android SDK**

   - Installed via Android Studio
   - Minimum SDK: API 21 (Android 5.0)
   - Target SDK: API 34

6. **Android Emulator or Physical Device**
   - Set up via Android Studio AVD Manager
   - Or connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled

### For iOS Development (macOS only)

7. **Xcode** (latest version)

   - Download from Mac App Store
   - Install command line tools: `xcode-select --install`

8. **CocoaPods**

   - Install: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
   - Verify: `pod --version`

9. **iOS Simulator or Physical Device**
   - Comes with Xcode
   - Or connect a physical iOS device

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosalah30/Business-Code-.git
cd Business-Code-
```

### 2. Verify Flutter Installation

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report. Fix any issues marked with ‚ùå before proceeding.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This will download all the required packages listed in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 4. Generate Hive Type Adapters

The app uses Hive for local storage, which requires generated code:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This generates the following files:

- `lib/features/home/data/models/user.g.dart`
- `lib/features/home/data/models/business_card.g.dart`

**Note:** These files are already included in the repository, but you may need to regenerate them if you modify the models.

### 5. Run the App

#### On Android

```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run
```

#### On iOS (macOS only)

```bash
# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# Run on simulator/device
flutter run
```

#### On Web (Optional)

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 6. Build for Release

#### Android APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

#### Android App Bundle (for Play Store)

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

#### iOS (macOS only)

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

Then open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode to archive and distribute.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "flutter: command not found"

**Solution:** Add Flutter to your PATH

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

Add this line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)

#### 2. "Gradle build failed"

**Solution:**

- Clean the build: `flutter clean`
- Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
- Try again: `flutter run`

#### 3. "CocoaPods not installed" (iOS)

**Solution:**

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

#### 4. "Hive type adapter not found"

**Solution:** Regenerate the adapters

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### 5. "Version solving failed"

**Solution:**

- Delete `pubspec.lock`
- Run `flutter pub get`
- If still failing, check Flutter version compatibility

#### 6. Android license issues

**Solution:**

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Accept all licenses when prompted.

#### 7. iOS signing issues

**Solution:**

- Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
- Select your development team in Signing & Capabilities
- Ensure you have a valid provisioning profile
